         <p>I am a freshman at Bob Jones University majoring in Blibical Studies. I work for the Sushi with Gusto.</p>
         <p>
            I enjoy participating in community outreach events, and I am active in my local church: Christ Mission Church, GA.  I teach Sunday School for the College &amp; Career group and I run the Sound / Video Projection System during services.  I also drive the church bus for weekend activities.

            I also enjoy sleeping / reading as well as a good video game (Smite) to be specific
